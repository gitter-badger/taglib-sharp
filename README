To Test/Run from Visual Studio (Windows):
 
 Running regression by using Nunit 3 Test Adapter:
  1. Ensure NuGet packages have been restored
        See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore
  2. In Visual Studio, go to menu: Tools > Extensions and Updates > Online
  3. Search: Nunit 3 Test Adapter
  4. Download and install it
  5. Open from menu: Test > Windows > Test Explorer
  6. You can run your tests from this panel (*not* using the "Start" button)
  7. You can debug your tests from this panel: 
     6.1. Double click on a test. Set some breakpoints in the test in the editor panel.
     6.2. right-click on the same test, select "Debug Selected tests". 

 To test some scenarios and take advantage of the debugger:
  1. Make the "debug" project the Startup project 
    (Right-click on the project, select: "Set as StartUp Project")
  2. Just modify the "Program.cs" 
  3. Set some breakpoints and hit the "Start" button
